# SocialNetwork in style "Twin Peaks" on TypeScript
This is a simple social network that helps me learn Typescript. I'm learning React at the best course of IT-KAMASUTRA on YouTube. I added some of my own and also made a design in the style of a cult series from the 90s. Because I use the API, which was kindly provided by the author of the channel, so far users do not always look like city dwellers :).
### In the first release (Release1) I use HOK and Container Component with few hooks.
